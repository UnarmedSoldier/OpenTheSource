### A community initiative to bring Open Source tooling to Valve's Steam Client, by default.
With benefits included for TF2, CS2, and other related communities, as well as their modding communities, via a proposal to open source the source engine, on top of general workshop update, with a focus on steam deck expansion, even from V1.
